# All the networks and datasets

This project aims to provide simple implementations of most of the state of the
art DNNs, SSD-DNNs, GANs, RNNs, etc.

The networks are stored in `networks` and have been trained with well know
datasets such as ImageNet, Cifar 10, mnist, fashion-mnist, COCO, VOC, etc.

The following table with links to the notebooks will be extend as more models
and datasets are added.

| Model | Notebook | Dataset Used | TF Version | Validation Accuracy | Training Time |
|:-----:|:--------:|:------------:|:----------:|--------------------:|--------------:|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Loading Public Notebooks Directly from GitHub

This information was extracted from:
`https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb`

Colab can load public github notebooks directly, with no required authorization
step.

For example, consider the notebook at this address:
https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb.

The direct colab link to this notebook is:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb.

To generate such links in one click, you can use the [Open in
Colab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo)
Chrome extension.
